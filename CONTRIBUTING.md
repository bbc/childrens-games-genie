## Contributing to this project

Ideally, issues should include:
1. What you expected to see
2. What you actually saw
3. What you did to reproduce the issue

If you can fix the problem, then please create a pull request with the fix, we aim to review new issues and pull requests on a weekly basis, however, we do not guarantee this.

Any pull request that contains a version number change will be rejected; release creation is a separate process.

To ensure that changes are reviewed, no one person should merge their own pull requests.
